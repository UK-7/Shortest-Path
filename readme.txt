CS 430 Project on Shortest Path

Written in Python 2.7

Implemented:
	Utilities:
	- Basic Timing Functions
	- Plotting Libraries
	
	Data Structures:
	- Generation of Random Adjacency Matrix
	- Heap
	
	Algorithms: 
	- Dijkstra (list and heap)
	- Bellman Ford (most naive)
	- Bellman Ford (less naive - only look at relaxed nodes)
	- Floyd-Warshal (most naive)
	- Johnsons

To Implement:
	- Algorithms with Adjacency Lists instead of Matricies
	Algorithms:
	- A*
	
	Utilities:
	- Lots of Test Cases
	- Graphing Library for all-pairs shortest paths

Work Distribution:
 - TBA

Jason Currently working on:
- Improving heap dijkstra (right now it is slower than the standard implementation)

Utkarsh currently working on:
- Learning python :)




Required packages: 
- numpy
- line_profiler
- matplotlb
